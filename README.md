# RollFor
A World of Warcraft (1.12.1) addon that manages rolling for items.  

## Demo

### Overview

In this example, the addon shows the soft-ressed items in the loot list.  
The Master Looter raid-rolls the trash item, then rolls non-SR items.  
Then the SR items are rolled.

### Tie roll

In this example, the addon automatically detects that the item is soft-reserved by two players.  
It restricts rolling for the item to these players only and resolves any tie automatically.  
The Master Looter then assigns the item directly to the winner.

## Usage

### Roll item
```
/rf <item link>
```

---

### Raid-roll item from your bags

### Insta Raid-roll item from your bags
```
/irr <item link>
```

---

### Roll for 2 items (two top rolls win)
```
/rf 2x<item link>

### Ignore SR and allow everyone to roll
If the item is SRed, the addon will only watch rolls for players who SRed.
However, if you want everyone to roll, even if the item is SRed, use `/arf`
instead of `/rf`. "arf" stands for "All Roll For".

## Soft-Res setup

1. Create a Soft Res list at https://raidres.fly.dev.  
2. Ask raiders to add their items.
3. When ready, lock the raid and click on **RollFor export** button.

4. Click on **Copy RollFor data to clipboard** buton.

<img src="docs/raidres-copy-to-clipboard.jpg" alt="Raidres copy to clipboard" style="width:720px;height:350">

5. Click on the minimap icon or type `/sr`.  
6. Paste the data into the window.  
7. Click **Import!**.  

<img src="docs/softres-import.jpg" alt="softres-import" style="width:720px;height:350">

The addon will tell you the status of SR import.  
Hovering over the minimap icon will tell you who did not soft-res.  

The minimap icon will be **green** if everyone in the group is soft-ressing.  
The minimap icon will be **orange** if someone has not soft-ressed.  
The minimap icon will be **red** if you have an outdated soft-res data.  
The minimap icon will be **white** if there is no soft-res data.  

To show the SR items type:
```
/srs
```

If someone needs to update their items, repeat the process and copy the data again.


### Soft-Res data format

The SR data from *Raidres* is a **Base64** encoded **JSON**. Decode it to see what's inside.

### Fixing mistyped player names in SR setup

When using soft-res, the players sometimes mistype their nickname, e.g. 
`Johnny` in game will be `Jonnhy` in the raidres.fly.dev website.  
The addon is smart enough to fix simple typos like that for you.  
It will also deal with special characters in player names.  
However, sometimes there's so many typos and the addon can't match the  
player's name - you have to fix it manually.  

`/sro` (stands for SR Override) is the command to do this.  

---


### Finish rolls early
```
/fr
```

---


### Cancel rolls
```
/cr
```

---


### Show soft-ressed items
```
/srs
```

---


### Check soft-res status (to see if everyone is soft-ressing)
```
/src
```

---


### Clear soft-res data
Click on the minimap icon and click **Clear** or type:  
```
/sr init
```

My character **Jogobobek** will no longer be available on Turtle WoW.  
I'm switching to Netherwing 3.0, perhaps under a different name :P
